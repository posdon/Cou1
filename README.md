Discord bot with some bizuth

This project of bot is a student's made project. The goal of the project is to enhance our java's skills but, at the first point, create something funny for us.
If you aren't from our project's group, you might not have all our reference and miss a lot of joke.


## How to DEV ?

We will use JDA Discord to create our bot. You can easily find some tutorials on Youtube to apprehend it.
Go [here](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA/releases) to download the JDA 3.5.1_339 with dependencies.
Then, for Eclipse's users, create a new users librairy from this jar into "Preferences -> Java -> Build path -> Users librairies" and add it to your project. (We might swap to maven one day)
If you need JDA documentation, [here it is](http://home.dv8tion.net:8080/job/JDA/javadoc/).

## The final goal (IN PROGRESS)

Put below all the idea you might have for the game. It would be better if you think about the game without thinking about *how I will developpe that*.

Proposal 1: Every day/every two days/.../every week, the bot chooses someone and sends him a private message. The chosen one has to follow certain rules (Which rules? Good question. Any ideas?). At the end of the time period, everyone can vote for one person, of which he thinks he was chosen by the bot. The ones who are right receive points and at the end of a semester we have a winner.
Proposal 2: The bot plays hangman with us.
Proposal 3: A bot with some minigames (like one where the player has to be the first to write a word in the chat, hangman, ...) and more complex games like Town of Salem or Werewolf.
